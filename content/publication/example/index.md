abstract: The inverse Faraday effect allows the generation of stationary
  magnetic fields through optical excitation only. This light–matter interaction
  in metals results from creating drift currents via nonlinear forces that light
  applies to the conduction electrons. Here, we describe the theory underlying
  the generation of drift currents in metals, particularly its application to
  photonic nanostructures using numerical simulations. We demonstrate that a
  gold photonic nanoantenna, optimized by a genetic algorithm, allows, under
  high excitation power, to maximize the drift currents and generate a pulse of
  stationary magnetic fields in the tesla range. This intense magnetic field,
  confined at the nanoscale and for a few femtoseconds, results from annular
  optical confinement and not from the creation of a single optical hot spot.
  Moreover, by controlling the incident polarization state, we demonstrate the
  orientation control of the created magnetic field and its reversal on demand.
  Finally, the stationary magnetic field’s temporal behavior and the drift
  currents associated with it reveal the subcycle nature of this light–matter
  interaction. The manipulation of drift currents by a plasmonic nanostructure
  for the generation of stationary magnetic field pulses finds applications in
  the ultrafast control of magnetic domains with applications not only in data
  storage technologies but also in research fields such as magnetic trapping,
  magnetic skyrmion, magnetic circular dichroism, to spin control, spin
  precession, spin currents, and spin-waves, among others.
